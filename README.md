## ðŸš€ Examples
### On-Delivery vendor Agreement (Escrow)
- Buyer and supplier sign vendor agreement with on-delivery payment terms
- Buyer locks token in escrow account
- Supplier issues delivery note
- If the buyer confirms delivery note, the locked tokens are released to Supplier
- If the supplier fails to issue a delivery note, the tokens are returned to the buyer's wallet

### Invoice-Backed loans
- Buyer and Supplier sign vendor agreement contract
- Supplier issues a delivery note and buyer confirms it
- Supplier issues invoice
- Supplier draws draws credit against pending invoice
- Supplier is given 80% of the invoice value up-front
- When buyer pays the invoice, the supplier gets the 20% remaining value less 3% service charge

## ðŸš€ Areas of Improvement
- User KYC and verification to add trust between contracting parties.
- Credit score and limits, to ensure the creditworthiness of users
- A dispute resolution system for contracts has to be implemented. This will ensure a fair, non-partisan handling of contract disputes.
